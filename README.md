# 💼 Loan Default Prediction

## 📌 Project Objective
To predict the likelihood of a loan applicant defaulting on a loan using historical credit data. The goal is to derive business insights that help financial institutions make better lending decisions.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Loan defaults increase credit risk for lenders and reduce profitability. This project uses data analysis and machine learning (optional) to identify patterns and predict defaults.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub

## 📝 Sample Business Insights
- Customers with credit history < 2 years have a 3x higher default rate.
- Borrowers with high debt-to-income ratios are riskier.
- Income and employment type significantly influence default likelihood.
